## VaporDB-FrontEnd

Welcome redditors and IRC'ers. We're excited to start a new _opensource_ project that will be driven by the community. Eventually, this website will have very little involvement from moderation staff. It will be entirely self-sufficient based on community involvement.

VaporDB will be a place for reviews of Atty's, APV's, and eventually any product that is physical hardware associated with vaping. You won't buy from VaporDB. Our product is honest, community driven reviews with no angle. You'll be able to vote on people's reviews as well. Ones which you found to be helpful or unhelpful.

Lastly, we need your support. We don't need your money - just your time and innovative thinking. Help us design the functionality behind VaporDB v1. Simply join in editing on the [Issues](https://github.com/VaporDB/VaporDB-FrontEnd/issues) page.

## Before you start adding features

Our features are broken down with labels. New features are labeled with the appropriate "New Feature" label. When creating new features please  be mindful of the workflow other users have already been working on. For every featureset, there needs to be an appropriate workflow to represent how the process should work. I've taken the liberty to do the first examples.

When talking about user interfaces please make sure to describe the datatypes. Can the user select multiple? Is this to be toggled on/off, yes/no, true/false? Is the numeric value measured in a particular unit of measure? etc...

We'll refine this as we go, it's all a learning process really. Be sure to check back here to hear the latest word from us. Also, be sure to lookup [GitHub Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) for learning to format.
